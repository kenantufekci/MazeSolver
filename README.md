# MazeSolver

This program was written in C++ using breadth first search to solve any maze
with a starting and ending point.

The maze files that was included are examples that can be changed as long as the 
same format is followed.

- The first set of numbers (7 20) is the demesion of the maze
- The second set of numbers (6 12) is the ending location in the maze grid
- The third set of numbers (0 18) is the starting location in the maze grid
